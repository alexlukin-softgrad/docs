# Creating an Organization

Organizations are created on the npm website.

## Sign-up for Orgs
* Follow this [link](https://www.npmjs.com/org?join-beta)
* Give a human-readable name to your org, e.g "npm, Inc."
* Name your org scope, e.g. @npminc
* Click "make it so" button to proceed to the next page
* Add team members (by their npm username) to your org

## Migrating an existing username to an Org
Many users have already registered an npm user with the @scope they want to use for their org. If you attempt to register an org with a scope already in use, and you are already logged in as that user, you will be prompted to automatically migrate that user to an org.

Once your @scope is owned by an org, **you can no longer log in as your former username**. Orgs are not users and do not have usernames and passwords. During migration, you will be prompted to pick a new username. This new user will have the same password as your old user, but all packages that belonged to your old user will now belong to the org. Your new user will have Super-Admin privileges to the org.
